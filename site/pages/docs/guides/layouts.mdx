# Layouts [Customizing the page layout in Vocs]

Vocs comes with three built-in layouts: `docs`, `landing`, and `minimal`. Each layout is styled differently, and has its own set of components which are displayed on the page.

You can specify which layout to use by setting the `layout` property in your frontmatter.

## Docs (Default)

The `docs` layout is the default layout for all pages. It includes documentation related components like the "edit page" link, outline, and footer navigation.

```md
---
// [!code focus]
layout: docs
---

# A docs page

This is a docs page.
```

## Landing

The `landing` layout is a special layout that can be used for a homepage. It does not include a sidebar or any documentation related components.

```md
---
// [!code focus]
layout: landing
---

This is a landing page.
```

:::info
An example of a `landing` layout page can be found on the Vocs home page.

### `HomePage` component

You can also leverage Vocs' built-in `<HomePage>{:tsx}` components to template a minimal home page.

:::code-group

```mdx [index.mdx]
---
layout: landing
---

import { HomePage } from 'vocs/components'

<HomePage.Root>
  <HomePage.Logo />
  <HomePage.Tagline>React Documentation Framework, powered by Vite</HomePage.Tagline>
  <HomePage.InstallPackage name="vocs" type="init" />
  <HomePage.Description>Vocs is a minimal static documentation generator designed to supercharge your documentation workflow, built with modern web technologies.</HomePage.Description>
  <HomePage.Buttons>
    <HomePage.Button href="/docs" variant="accent">Get started</HomePage.Button>
    <HomePage.Button href="https://github.com/wevm/vocs">GitHub</HomePage.Button>
  </HomePage.Buttons>
</HomePage.Root>
```

<div data-title="Preview">
  <HomePage.Root>
    <HomePage.Logo />
    <HomePage.Tagline>React Documentation Framework, powered by Vite</HomePage.Tagline>
    <HomePage.InstallPackage name="vocs" type="init" />
    <HomePage.Description>Vocs is a minimal static documentation generator designed to supercharge your documentation workflow, built with modern web technologies.</HomePage.Description>
    <HomePage.Buttons>
      <HomePage.Button href="/docs" variant="accent">Get started</HomePage.Button>
      <HomePage.Button href="https://github.com/wevm/vocs">GitHub</HomePage.Button>
    </HomePage.Buttons>
  </HomePage.Root>
</div>

## Minimal

The `minimal` layout is a barebones, blank layout. It does not include any documentation related components, and is useful for pages that don't need them, like a blog.

```md
---
// [!code focus]
layout: minimal
---

# A minimal page

This page uses a minimal layout.
```

:::info
An example of a `minimal` layout page can be found on the [Blog page](/blog).

## Frontmatter Options

You can also control the layout of the page through Frontmatter options.

[See here for a list of all Frontmatter options](/docs/api/frontmatter).

### Examples

The example below demonstrates a `docs` layout page with no sidebar, outline or logo:

```md
---
// [!code focus]
showSidebar: false 
// [!code focus]
showOutline: false 
// [!code focus]
showLogo: false 
---

This is a page without a sidebar, outline, or logo.
```

The example below demonstrates a `minimal` layout page with no logo:

```md
---
// [!code focus]
layout: minimal
// [!code focus]
showLogo: false
---

This is a minimal layout without the logo.
```

The example below demonstrates a `landing` layout page with a viewport width that spans the width of the page:

```md
---
// [!code focus]
layout: landing
// [!code focus]
content:
  // [!code focus]
  horizontalPadding: 0px
  // [!code focus]
  width: 100%
  // [!code focus]
  verticalPadding: 0px
---

This is a minimal layout without the logo.
```
