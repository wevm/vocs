# Vocs [Static documentation generator powered by Vite and React]

## Overview

Vocs is a static documentation generator powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [React](https://react.dev).

Write your content in [Markdown](#TODO) or [MDX](#TODO), and Vocs will generate a static site with a default theme.

## Quick Start

Scaffold a new project with the command line:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm init vocs
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create vocs
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create vocs
```

```bash [bun]
bun x vocs init -i bun
```

:::

## Manual Installation

You can install Vocs in an existing project, or start from scratch, by installing Vocs as a dependency.

::::steps

### Install

First, we will install `vocs` as a dependency in our project.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i vocs
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i vocs
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add vocs
```

```bash [bun]
bun i vocs
```

### Add Scripts to `package.json`

After that, let's add some scripts to our `package.json` for Vocs.

```json [package.json]
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": { // [!code focus]
    "docs:dev": "vocs dev", // [!code focus] 
    "docs:build": "vocs build", // [!code focus]
    "docs:preview": "vocs preview" // [!code focus]
  } // [!code focus]
}
```

### Build your First Page

Create a directory called `docs`, and add a file inside of it called `index.mdx`:

```markdown [docs/index.mdx]
# Hello, World! [This is my first page]

Welcome to my docs. 
```

### Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev
```

Then open up your browser to `http://localhost:5173`, and you can see your first page!
